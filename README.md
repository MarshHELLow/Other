# Python_JetBrains_Learn
Projects developed while learning the Python language at the JetBrains academy. Basically, this repository contains small games in the command line terminal, based on which I learned how to work with loops, functions, arrays, etc.
 
1. Last_Pencil. Game - "The Last Pencil". The user enters the initial number of pencils on the table, and then chooses who will go first - the Bot or the   player himself. Then the players take turns taking a certain number of pencils from the table - from 1 to 3. The player who took the last pencil from the table is considered the loser. The logic of the Bot in this program is written in such a way that it cannot be defeated. 

2. Gallows_Game. 
The game "Gallows" implemented in the Python command line. The game has a dictionary from which a word is randomly selected and a text menu that allows you to play several games, see the results and exit the game.

3. Tic_Tac_Toe.
Tic-tac-toe game written in Python. The game interface is made of symbols and implemented via the command line. The program has a menu through which the user can start the game, view the results or exit the program.
