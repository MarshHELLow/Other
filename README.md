# Python_JetBrains_Learn
Projects developed while learning the Python language at the JetBrains academy

1. Bot_JB.
A program that I wrote when I started learning how to program in Python. This is a Bot that introduces itself to the user and asks him a series of questions, demonstrating his capabilities, and then asks a series of questions to the user as a quiz.

2. Last_Pencil_JB_vs_Bot.
Game - "The Last Pencil". The user enters the initial number of pencils on the table, and then chooses who will go first - the Bot or the player himself. Then the players take turns taking a certain number of pencils from the table - from 1 to 3. The player who took the last pencil from the table is considered the loser. The logic of the Bot in this program is written in such a way that it cannot be defeated.

3. Gallows_Game. 
The game "Gallows" implemented in the Python command line. The game has a dictionary from which a word is randomly selected and a text menu that allows you to play several games, see the results and exit the game.
