# Python_JetBrains_Learn
Projects developed while learning the Python language at the JetBrains academy. Basically, this repository contains small games in the command line terminal, based on which I learned how to work with loops, functions, arrays, etc.

1. Bot_JB.
A program that I wrote when I started learning how to program in Python. This is a Bot that introduces itself to the user and asks him a series of questions, demonstrating his capabilities, and then asks a series of questions to the user as a quiz.
 
2. Last_Pencil_JB_vs_Bot. Game - "The Last Pencil". The user enters the initial number of pencils on the table, and then chooses who will go first - the Bot or the   player himself. Then the players take turns taking a certain number of pencils from the table - from 1 to 3. The player who took the last pencil from the table is considered the loser. The logic of the Bot in this program is written in such a way that it cannot be defeated. 

3. Gallows_Game. 
The game "Gallows" implemented in the Python command line. The game has a dictionary from which a word is randomly selected and a text menu that allows you to play several games, see the results and exit the game.

4. Honest_Calculator.
A calculator that allows the user to perform simple mathematical operations, save an intermediate result, and at the same time comment in every possible way on incorrect user actions. In this project, I learned to work with exceptions.
